pVACfuse
====================================

This component of the pVACtools workflow provides support for predicting
neoantigens from gene fusions. Currently, fusion variants as reported by
`INTEGRATE-Neo <https://github.com/ChrisMaherLab/INTEGRATE-Neo>`_ are supported, and predictions against any of the
IEDB-supported prediction softwares can be reported.
