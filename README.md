pVACtools is a cancer immunotherapy tools suite consisting of the following tools:

**pVACseq**
A cancer immunotherapy pipeline for identifying and prioritizing neoantigens from a list of tumor mutations.
**pVACfuse**
A tool for detecting neoantigens resulting from gene fusions.
**pVACvector**
A tool designed to aid specifically in the construction of DNA-based cancer vaccines.
**pVACclient**

## Installation
We're currently in the process of preparing pVACtools for packaging. Once finished, pVACtools will be available on PyPi and available for install using `pip`.

For the time being pVACseq is still available as a standalone package and can be installed using `pip install pvacseq`. The original pVACseq documentation can be found on <a href="http://pvac-seq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">readthedocs</a>.
